# Password_Manager
A password manager written in Python.
The password manager works entirely through commands entered from the console and contains various functions that can be explored through the help function. 
Before being able to use the password manager it is necessary to change the paths of the files that are used and generated inside the code. This software allows you 
to make a backup of all encrypted data on a file using the "download" function. it is possible to search for a record inserted through the function "record", and it is possible 
to search for it either through "util" ex. gmail, facebook, etc ... that by email / username or password. After creating a master password at first start, it will be requested 
every time before starting the software. After the creation, the master password will be saved in a file, obviously encrypted, and it is possible to decrypt it only 
through the key present in another file. Each time you start the software, you will be asked for the master password, if the password will be wrong more than 3 times, all 
the records will be deleted. You can start the software simply by double-clicking on the .exe file (Thanks to PyToExe).
